Welcome to my collection of Python codes, a treasure trove designed for individuals beginning their journey in Python programming, as well as those at an intermediate level looking to enhance their skills. This repository contains a variety of scripts and small projects that cover fundamental concepts, standard libraries, and problem-solving techniques in Python.

## üìö What's Inside

| Script | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `basics.py` | Demonstrates basic syntax and operations. |
| `loops.py` | Examples of control structures like loops and conditional statements. |
| `functions.py` | Functions and modular programming illustrations. |
| ... | And more! |

Each script is documented with comments explaining the purpose, functionality, and usage.

## üöÄ Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/PiyushBadule/Python_Codes.git

# Navigate to the Repository:
cd Python_Codes

# Run a Script (Replace <script_name> with the file you wish to run):
python3 <script_name>.py

# üõ† How to Use:
# Each script is standalone and demonstrates a specific concept or problem. 
# To make the most out of this repository:
# - Read the Comments: Each script contains comments that explain what it does and how it works.
# - Run and Modify: Run the scripts as they are, then try modifying them to see how the changes affect the outcome.
# - Practice Regularly: Consistency is key in learning. Try to understand and practice regularly by tweaking the code and attempting to solve similar problems on your own.
